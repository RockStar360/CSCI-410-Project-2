For the ClockrBot system, the Observer Design Pattern will be the choice for the system.
On the Supervisor Page, the Disable, Edit, Clock Out GA, UnDo, Information Report,
View Real-Time, and Print component features are the sub-systems would used the 
Observer Design Pattern. On the GA Page, the Clock In and Clock Out, and Break Checkbox 
component features are the sub-systems would also used the Observer Design Pattern.
The reason why I chosed the Observer Design Pattern is because it is a one-to-many
dependency between the objects. If one of the objects changes the state, then all its
dependents identify the changes and will be automatically updated. The Observer design 
pattern will likely improve the ClockrBot System like for instance the GA page whenever
the GA clock in, clock out, or the break checkbox is pressed, each one of the sub-system will 
be notified and the system as a whole will update the User-Interface (UI) displaying new 
information, this will also apply the same to the supervisor page as well with its own component
features. With Observer Design Pattern, it will allow the system as a whole to run efficiently
allowing all the sub-system components to correspond each other on the new changes that occurs 
and the system will update the information automatically.
